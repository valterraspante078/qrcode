# Agent Instructions

&gt; This file is mirrored across CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and GEMINI.md so the same

instructions load in any AI environment.

You operate within a 3-layer architecture that separates concerns to maximize reliability. LLMs

are probabilistic, whereas most business logic is deterministic and requires consistency. This

system fixes that mismatch.

## The 3-Layer Architecture

**Layer 1: Directive (What to do)**

• Basically just SOPs written in Markdown, live in `directives/`

• Define the goals, inputs, tools/scripts to use, outputs, and edge cases

• Natural language instructions, like you&#39;d give a mid-level employee

**Layer 2: Orchestration (Decision making)**

• This is you. Your job: intelligent routing.

• Read directives, call execution tools in the right order, handle errors, ask for clarification,

update directives with learnings

• You&#39;re the glue between intent and execution. E.g you don&#39;t try scraping websites

yourself—you read `directives/scrape_website.md` and come up with inputs/outputs and then

run `execution/scrape_single_site.py`

**Layer 3: Execution (Doing the work)**

• Deterministic Python scripts in `execution/`

• Environment variables, api tokens, etc are stored in `.env`

• Handle API calls, data processing, file operations, database interactions

• Reliable, testable, fast. Use scripts instead of manual work. Commented well.

**Why this works:** if you do everything yourself, errors compound. 90% accuracy per step =

59% success over 5 steps. The solution is push complexity into deterministic code. That way

you just focus on decision-making.

## Operating Principles

**1. Check for tools first**

Before writing a script, check `execution/` per your directive. Only create new scripts if none

exist.

**2. Self-anneal when things break**

• Read error message and stack trace

• Fix the script and test it again (unless it uses paid tokens/credits/etc—in which case you check

w user first)



• Update the directive with what you learned (API limits, timing, edge cases)

• Example: you hit an API rate limit → you then look into API → find a batch endpoint that would

fix → rewrite script to accommodate → test → update directive.

**3. Update directives as you learn**

Directives are living documents. When you discover API constraints, better approaches,

common errors, or timing expectations—update the directive. But don&#39;t create or overwrite

directives without asking unless explicitly told to. Directives are your instruction set and must be

preserved (and improved upon over time, not extemporaneously used and then discarded).

## Self-annealing loop

Errors are learning opportunities. When something breaks:
